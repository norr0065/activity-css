    <h1> Humans of New York</h1>  
    
    <p>The blog, <strong>Humans of New York</strong>, was created in the summer of 2010. HONY, another term for the blog Humans of New York, resulted from an idea to construct a photographic census of New York City. Creator Brandon, who's last name is unknown, thought it would be really cool to create an exhaustive catalogue of the cityâ€™s inhabitants, so he set out to photograph 10,000 New Yorkers and plot their photos on a map. He worked for several months with this goal in mind. But somewhere along the way, HONY began to take on a much different character. He started collecting quotes and short stories from the people he had met, and began including these snippets alongside the photographs. Taken together, these portraits and captions became the subject of a vibrant blog, which over the past two years has gained a large daily following. With nearly <em>one million</em> collective followers on Facebook and Tumblr, HONY now provides a worldwide audience with glimpses into the lives of strangers in New York City.</p>

    <p> "At first we kept saying: <em>'We're going to beat it. We're going to beat it.'</em> Then after awhile we began to realize that we might not beat it. Then toward the end, it became clear that we definitely weren't going to beat it. That's when she started telling me that she wanted me to move on and find happiness with somebody else. But I'm not quite there yet. Not long ago a noise woke me up in the middle of the night, and I rolled over to ask if she needed anything."</p>

"I'm a retired professor. Every time I've spoken to a large group of people, <strong>hardly anyone was listening.</strong>"</p>
